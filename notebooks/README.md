# Notebooks

Store Jupyter notebooks for exploratory statistics and probability work here. Suggested naming convention:

```
notebooks/
  assignment01_descriptive.ipynb
  assignment02_probability.ipynb
```

Keep notebooks lean by importing helpers from `statprob` instead of duplicating logic. When finished, export relevant plots to include with your assignment submission.
